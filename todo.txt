white king goes from e1 to g1

pst g1 - pst e1 = 60040 - 60006 = 34

white black goes from e8 to g8

pst g8 - pst e8 = 60040 - 60006 = 34

=============================================

always yield Move(immediate), score(computation)

for moveValue, move in genActualMovesSorted:
  yield Move(immediate) score(computation OR immediate)









========================================
gen special moves (use move.moveType)
try special moves one by one and see if best >= gamma
gen moves
flag moves with their values
sort moves based on their values
try special moves one by one and see if best >= gamma

define doMove that reads move.moveType




========================================
amÃ©liorations:
save tpMove if depth > tpMove.depth? else best move overwritten?
call pos.value only once and store it inside move?
